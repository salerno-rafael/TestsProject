Functional test tends to answer the questions like “can the user do this” or “does this particular feature work”. 
This is typically described in a requirements specification or in a functional specification.

sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, 
usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
