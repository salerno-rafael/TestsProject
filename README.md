#Functional testing with Selenium

In functional testing basically the testing of the functions of component or system is done. 
It refers to activities that verify a specific action or function of the code. 
Functional test tends to answer the questions like “can the user do this” or “does this particular feature work”. 
This is typically described in a requirements specification or in a functional specification.

#Unit Test

unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, 
sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, 
usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.


#Contract Testing
this kind of tests has the same intention of integration tests, check the internal behavior on system but in this case avoiding influence with externals componets.
